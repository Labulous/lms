**# Current file structure**


**# Additional requirements**
1. Project setup:
    - All new componenets should go in /components at the root (not in the app folder) and named like example-component.tsx unless otherwise specified
    - All new pages go in /app
    - Use the Next.js 14 app router
    - All data fetching should be done in a server component and pass the data down as props
    - Client components (useState, hooks, etc) require that 'use client' is set at the top of the files
    
2. Server-side API Calls:
    - All interactions with external APIs should be performed server-side to avoid exposing sensitive information.
    - Create dedicated API routes in the 'pages/api' directory for each external API interaction.
    - Client-side components should fetch data through these API routes, not directly from the external APIs.
    - Implement error handling for failed API calls.

3. Environment variables:
    - Use environment variables to store sensitive information such as API keys and tokens.
    - Store these in a '.env' file at the root of the project.
    - Use the 'dotenv' package to load these variables into the application.

4. Error handling and logging:
    - Implement a centralized error handling mechanism for both client and server components.
    - Use the 'next/error' component to display error messages to the user.
    - Log erros on the server-side for debugging purposes.
    - Display user-friendly error messages on the client-side.
    
5. Type safety:
    - Use TypeScript to its fullest extent to ensure type safety for all data.
    - Define types for API responses and use them to type the data in your application.
    - Avoid using 'any' type in your code. Define proper types for all variables and function parameters.

6. API Client Initialization:
    - Create a dedicated API client module for making API requests.
    - Initialize the API client with the base URL and any necessary headers or authentication tokens.
    - Use the API client in your application to make API requests.
    - Implement error handling for failed API calls.
    - Implement checks to ensure that the API client is not used before it is initialized.

7. Code quality:
    - Write clean, readable code with clear variable names and comments where necessary.
    - Follow best practices for code organization, modularity, and reusability.
    - Use the 'eslint' package to lint your code and fix any issues.

8. Data Fetching in Components:
    - Data fetching should be done in a server component and pass the data down as props.
    - Client components should use the 'use' prefix for hooks and state variables.
    - Use React hooks like 'useState', 'useEffect', and 'useContext' sparingly for data fetching in client-side components.

9. Security:
    - Implement security best practices such as rate limiting, input validation, and secure session management.
    - Use the 'helmet' package to set security-related HTTP headers.

10. Next.js Configuration:
    - Use the 'next' package to configure your Next.js application.
    - Set the 'next' package to use the 'app' directory.
    - Use the 'env' package to store environment variables.

**# User Management**

//from bolt.new//

These changes implement a basic authentication and authorization system for the Labulous Lab Management Platform. Here's a summary of what we've done:

1. Created a mock authentication service with login, logout, and user role management.
2. Added a login page for users to authenticate.
3. Implemented protected routes based on user authentication and roles.
4. Updated the Header to show the current user and a logout button.
5. Modified the Sidebar to display menu items based on the user's role.

To test the authentication:

Use the following credentials:

Admin: admin@example.com
Technician: tech@example.com
Client: client@example.com
Password: password (for all users)
Different user roles will see different menu items and have access to different pages.

Unauthenticated users will be redirected to the login page.

Users trying to access pages they don't have permission for will be redirected to the dashboard.

Remember that this is a basic implementation for demonstration purposes. In a production environment, you would need to implement proper security measures, such as:

1. Secure password hashing
2. HTTPS for all communications
3. Proper JWT implementation with secure token storage
4. Refresh token mechanism
5. Backend validation of user roles and permissions

-----

I've made several changes to fix the login redirect issue and improve the overall flow:

In Login.tsx:

Added a useEffect hook to check if the user is already authenticated. If so, it redirects to the dashboard immediately.
This ensures that if a user is already logged in and tries to access the login page, they'll be redirected to the dashboard.
In App.tsx:

Moved the Layout component inside the ProtectedRoute component.
This ensures that the layout (including the sidebar and header) is only rendered for authenticated routes.
In Home.tsx:

Updated the greeting to use the actual user's name from the getCurrentUser() function.
This personalizes the dashboard greeting based on the logged-in user.
These changes should resolve the issue of not being redirected to the dashboard after logging in. The authentication flow should now work as follows:

If a user is not logged in and tries to access any protected route, they'll be redirected to the login page.
After successful login, the user will be redirected to the dashboard (home page).
If an already authenticated user tries to access the login page, they'll be automatically redirected to the dashboard.
The development server is already running, so these changes will be automatically applied. Please try logging in again, and you should be redirected to the dashboard with a personalized greeting.

If you're still experiencing issues, please let me know, and I'll be happy to help further troubleshoot the problem.

Client Information: Include the client name for reference.
API Integration:

Fetch the patient information from /api/clients/:clientId/patients/:patientId.
Styling:

Format the patient labels to fit standard label sizes (similar to medical labels).
3. Handling Print Logic
For each print option, the onPrintOptionSelect function will handle generating the appropriate printable page:

Handle Dropdown Selection:

When the user selects an option from the dropdown (e.g., "Invoice"), trigger the corresponding function to generate a printable page.
Each option should have its own function:
handlePrintInvoice()
handlePrintLabSlip()
handlePrintAddressLabel()
handlePrintQRCodeLabel()
handlePrintPatientLabel()
Print Page Layout:

After generating the content for the printable page, trigger the print functionality using window.print() or another method to display the print dialog.
State Management and Event Handling
Use React hooks (useState, useEffect) to manage the dropdown state and handle the print actions based on the user’s selection.
For the dropdown, you can use a simple select element or a dropdown component from a UI library (e.g., Material-UI, Ant Design, or Bootstrap).
Example structure for the dropdown:

jsx
Copy code
<Select
  value={selectedPrintOption}
  onChange={handlePrintOptionSelect}
>
  <Option value="invoice">Invoice</Option>
  <Option value="lab-slip">Lab Slip</Option>
  <Option value="address-label">Address Label</Option>
  <Option value="qr-code-label">QR Code Label</Option>
  <Option value="patient-label">Patient Label</Option>
</Select>
Once the user selects an option, call the appropriate handler function (e.g., handlePrintInvoice()).
File Structure
vbnet
Copy code
/components
    /cases
        - CaseList.tsx
        - CaseRow.tsx (Updated to include Print Button with Dropdown)
        - PrintButtonWithDropdown.tsx (New)
        - PrintPage.tsx (New for generating the printable content)
Backend API Endpoints
Ensure the API endpoints for fetching case details, invoices, client addresses, QR codes, and patient details are functional:
/api/cases/:caseId
/api/invoices/:invoiceId
/api/clients/:clientId
/api/cases/:caseId/qr
/api/clients/:clientId/patients/:patientId
Styling and UI Considerations
Dropdown Styling:

Style the dropdown to match the overall design of the platform. Use consistent colors and fonts to ensure the dropdown integrates smoothly with the rest of the UI.
Print Formatting:

Each printable slip should be formatted appropriately for A4, Letter, or label paper sizes.
Ensure margins are set correctly to avoid cutting off important information when printed.
Responsive Design:

Ensure that the dropdown and quick action buttons remain responsive and adapt well on smaller screens (mobile and tablet).
By following this prompt, the AI coding editor will be able to add a Print Button with Dropdown Options on the "Cases" page. Each option will generate a formatted slip (Invoice, Lab Slip, Address Label, QR Code Label, or Patient Label) and trigger the print functionality, providing users with an efficient and versatile printing tool.


**# Client Management**

Prompt: Build Client Management Component with Support for Multiple Doctors
Objective: Update the Client Management component to allow admins to specify and manage multiple doctors under a single client (dental clinic). The system should provide an option to select how many doctors are associated with a client, and dynamically add form fields for each doctor. Each doctor will have their own fields for Name, Phone, Email, and Notes.

Component Updates for Adding Multiple Doctors
1. Add New Client Form (Updated)
Component Name: AddClientForm

Updated Functionality:

In addition to the existing client fields (Client Name, Contact Name, Phone, Email, etc.), provide an option for selecting how many doctors are associated with the clinic.
Add a dropdown or number input to specify the number of doctors (default to 1).
Dynamically render the doctor fields based on the number selected. Each doctor should have the following fields:
Doctor Name (required)
Doctor Phone (required)
Doctor Email (required, with validation)
Doctor Notes (optional): A freeform text field for any additional information about the doctor.
As the number of doctors changes, the form should automatically add or remove doctor fields.

Usage Example:

jsx
Copy code
{Array(numberOfDoctors).fill().map((_, index) => (
  <DoctorFields
    key={index}
    index={index}
    doctor={doctors[index]}
    onChange={(updatedDoctor) => handleDoctorChange(index, updatedDoctor)}
  />
))}
State Management and Dynamic Field Handling
State for Client Data:

Use React hooks (useState, useEffect) to manage the state for the client details and the dynamically added doctor fields.
Doctor Fields: Use an array in the state to manage the doctor details. When the admin changes the number of doctors, adjust the array length accordingly.
Example state management for doctors:
jsx
Copy code
const [doctors, setDoctors] = useState([{ name: '', phone: '', email: '', notes: '' }]);

const handleDoctorChange = (index, updatedDoctor) => {
  const updatedDoctors = [...doctors];
  updatedDoctors[index] = updatedDoctor;
  setDoctors(updatedDoctors);
};

const handleDoctorCountChange = (count) => {
  setDoctors(Array(count).fill({ name: '', phone: '', email: '', notes: '' }));
};
Form Submission:

Ensure the full client data, including all doctors, is submitted as a single object when the form is submitted.
Validate that each doctor has the required fields filled in (Name, Phone, Email) before allowing submission.
Backend API Updates
API Payload:

Ensure the backend can handle the new data structure, where each client has an array of associated doctors.
When creating or updating a client, include the doctors array as part of the request body.
API Endpoints:

/api/clients/create: POST request to create a new client with associated doctors.
/api/clients/:clientId/edit: PUT request to update an existing client, including any changes to the associated doctors.
/api/clients/:clientId: GET request to fetch detailed client information, including the list of doctors.

    /clients
        - index.tsx (Client List Page)
        - [clientId].tsx (Client Details Page)
        - [clientId]/edit.tsx (Client Edit Page)
Styling and UI Considerations
Form Layout:

Ensure the doctor fields are laid out neatly and aligned with the rest of the form.
Use a card or collapsible sections for each doctor's information if there are multiple doctors, to avoid cluttering the form with too many fields.
Dynamic Fields:

Make sure that adding/removing doctor fields is smooth and that the UI dynamically adjusts without causing layout shifts.
Validation:

Ensure that required fields for each doctor (Name, Phone, Email) are validated before form submission.
Responsive Design:

Ensure the form and dynamically added doctor fields remain responsive, allowing for easy use on mobile devices and tablets.
